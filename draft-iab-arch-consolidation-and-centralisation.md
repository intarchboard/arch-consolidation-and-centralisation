--- abstract

Many of us have held a vision of the Internet as the ultimate distributed
platform that allows communication, the provision of services, and competition
from any corner of the world. But as the Internet has matured, it seems to also
feed the creation of large, centralised entities in many areas. This phenomenon
could be looked at from many different angles, but this memo considers the topic
from the perspective of how available technology and Internet architecture
either drives or is affected by different market directions.
