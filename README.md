# Challenges and Changes in the Internet Threat Model

This is the working area for an individual Internet-Draft that is hoped to become an IAB document in the future.

## Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have the necessary software installed.  See
[the instructions](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md).

In addition, since we're using "!INCLUDE" statements to handle
multiple input markdown files, you need to have ``markdown-pp``
available. To install that:

            sudo pip install MarkdownPP

## Contributing
